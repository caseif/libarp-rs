# libarp

ARP is a binary format for packing resource files in a structured manner. libarp is a reference implementation of
pack/unpack functionality for the format.

This repository contains a Rust rewrite of the original [libarp](https://github.com/caseif/libarp) library which is
written in C.

ARP's full specification can be found in the [SPEC.md](doc/SPEC.md) file in this repository.

## Compiling

libarp depends on [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/) for DEFLATE (de)compression support. This library is provided as a Git
submodule within this repository and will be automatically built alongside the root project.

To build:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
